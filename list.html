      <p class="takeaway"> Canes Takeaways </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Food portions were good and still very hot considering the amount of people waiting</li>
        <li>Dining area could have been a little bit bigger</li>
        <li>Chicken was nice and crunchy and even better with their signiture Canes® sauce</li>
        <li>Fries were also good and well saltened</li>
        <li>Their bread, their bread was so soft and well cooked it was the best bread I have ever tasted and even more better with the Canes® Chicken and fried in there.</li>
        <li>Lastly, one con is the sauce quantity, I think they could've given us a little more sauce.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="summary"> But overall Canes® was a good first time experience, from the food presentation to the time it took to recieve the food. I would give it a 9.5 out of 10 would definitley recommened</p>
